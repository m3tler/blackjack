# Blackjack - console game
I am currently improving my programming skills while developing a console game project, which is a simulation of the card game called Blackjack. I am learning how to write clean code, as well as learning the applications of basic design patterns in practice.

**Warning:** The game is in development and doesn't work yet, but you can still take a look at the code :)
